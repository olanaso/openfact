= Admin Theme

https://github.com/adminfaces/admin-theme[Admin Theme^] is a simple http://primefaces.org/themes[PrimeFaces theme^] where components are styled to look like AdminLTE ones (which in turn are based on Bootstrap).

== Prerequisites

The only pre-requisite is `PrimeFaces` and `Font Awesome`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since PrimeFaces `5.1.1` font awesome comes embedded.

For previous version or if you need to upgrade FA version you may include it in your pages by using webjars:

[source,html]
----
<h:outputStylesheet library="webjars" name="font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome-jsf.css" />
----

and add web jar in your classpath:

[source,xml]
----
include::{projectRoot}/pom.xml[tags=dep-webjar]
----

====

== Usage

To start using the theme you need the following:

. Add admin theme to your classpath:
+
[source,xml]
----
include::{projectRoot}/pom.xml[tags=dep-admin-theme]
----
. Activate the theme in `web.xml`
+
[source,xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>primefaces.THEME</param-name>
    <param-value>admin</param-value>
</context-param>
----
+
NOTE: If you use <<Admin Template>> the theme already comes activated.

Now PrimeFaces components are styled like Bootstrap and AdminLTE.

TIP: See {link-admin-showcase-openshift}/pages/form/forms.xhtml[showcase forms page^] to get an idea.


== Architecture

The theme uses {link-less}[less^] as css pre-processor. Each PrimeFaces component has its own less file:

.src/main/resources/less
----
├── admin-lte
│    |
│    ├── bootstrap <1>
│    │
│    ├── skins <2>
│    │
│    └── admin lte less files
│
├── primefaces-admin
│    |
│    ├─ components <3>
│    │   |
│    │   ├── accordeon.less
│    │   │
│    │   ├── autocomplete.less
│    │   │
│    │   └── etc...
│    │
│    ├─ theme.less <4>
│    │
     └─ variables.less
----
<1> Bootstrap variables and https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/useful-css3-less-mixins/[mixins^] are used as reference in AdminLTE and admin theme less files
<2> Built in skins
<3> PrimeFaces components
<4> Components and Admin-LTE less files are included in theme.less

After compilation it will generate the theme.css with Admin-LTE, Bootstrap and Primefaces components.

NOTE: Bootstrap.css (from src/META-INF/resources) is included in theme.less, bootstrap less is not maintained in this project only it's mixins.


== Development

To get your hands dirty with admin theme it is recommended to use <<Admin Designer>> in combination with http://brackets.io/[Brackets] or any tool that `compile less` files to css on save.

Using designer (which is backed by wildfly swarm) plus brackets will let you change the components less files and see the results instantly.

NOTE: theme.less is already brackets aware so you just need to change any component less file, save it and see the results in Admin Designer.
